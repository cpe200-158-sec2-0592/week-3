﻿# Implement the Fraction class according to the following requirements:

## Propeties:
- Numer: Numerator
- Denom: Denominator (default=1, cannot be 0)
- Count: counting #objects of this class (static)
Note: Numerator and Denominator have to in the minimal form.
      See r3 and r6.

## Constructors:///
- Fraction (): default constructor
- Fraction (Fraction a): copy constructor
- Fraction (numerator, denominator)
note: increment the Count property when an object is created

## Methods
- setValue: set fraction value
- GCD: calculate Greatest Common Divisor of two integers (static)

## Operator Overloading:
many many operators need to be overloaded!!! 

## Question?
1. Is the number of Fraction objects equal to the 'new' keywords used
   in the 'main' methods? How come?
   not equal  because when we start main its will call object Fraction(), Fraction(Fraction i), Fraction(int i, int j)
    and Fraction(int i) first and when it build Fraction r1,r1 will be no.5 of fraction object

2. Are the result, r3 and r7, in case#1 and case#2 the same? Why?
   equal because fraction r7 is the fraction that reborn from r3 so the result of fraction r7 and r3 will be equal

## Expected Output:

***** 3 Fraction objects have been created *****
***** 8 Fraction objects have been created *****
***** 12 Fraction objects have been created *****
[Rational: 0/1], value=0]
[Rational: 2/1], value=2]
